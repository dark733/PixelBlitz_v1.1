The `LoadingScreenController` class seems to be associated with an FXML file used for managing a loading screen in a JavaFX application. It includes methods to control a `ProgressBar` and execute actions when the loading process is complete.

Here's a breakdown of the class:

1. **FXML Injection**:
   - An instance of `ProgressBar` is injected via `@FXML` annotation.
   - The injected `ProgressBar` is referenced as `progressBar`.

2. **`setProgress(double progress)` Method**:
   - Updates the progress of the `ProgressBar` based on the provided `progress` value (between 0.0 and 1.0).
   - If the progress reaches or exceeds 1.0 (100%), it executes the action specified by the `onLoadingComplete` Runnable if it has been set.

3. **`setOnLoadingComplete(Runnable onLoadingComplete)` Method**:
   - Sets the `onLoadingComplete` action to be executed when the loading progress reaches completion (i.e., when progress >= 1.0).
   - Accepts a `Runnable` parameter, which represents the action to perform upon completion of the loading process.

This controller class likely interacts with the associated FXML file and allows for controlling and updating the progress bar based on the progress of the loading operation. The `onLoadingComplete` action can be defined externally and attached to this controller to handle tasks after the loading is finished, such as transitioning to another screen or performing specific operations.
