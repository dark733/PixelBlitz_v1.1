The `menu_bar` class seems to handle various menu-related events and navigation within the application.

Here's a description of the methods in the `menu_bar` class:

1. **`documentation_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Loads the "documentation.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader` and sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

2. **`references_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Loads the "References.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader` and sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

3. **`credits_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Loads the "Credits.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader` and sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

4. **`license_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Checks if the provided `Stage` is null or not and then loads the "license.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader`. Sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

5. **`easter_egg_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Checks if the provided `Stage` is null or not and then loads the "easterEgg.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader`. Sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

6. **`faq_event(Stage stage)`**:
   - Loads the "faq.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader` and sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

7. **`termsAndConditionsEvent(Stage stage)`**:
   - Loads the "t_and_c.fxml" file using `FXMLLoader` and sets its content as the scene for the provided `Stage`.

8. **`force_exit_event()`**:
   - Calls `Platform.exit()` to force exit the application.

9. **`mute_audio_event()`**:
   - Represents an empty method, possibly intended for muting audio but not implemented in the provided code.

These methods handle loading different FXML files and setting their content as scenes for the given `Stage`. Additionally, they manage certain events related to the application's menu and navigation system, such as showing documentation, references, credits, licenses, and other screens, as well as handling application exit.
