The given Java class Wall represents a wall object for a game or graphical application. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Attributes:

x, y: Represent the coordinates of the wall.
width, height: Define the dimensions of the wall.
startX: Holds the initial x-coordinate of the wall.
color: Represents the color of the wall.
hitBox: A Rectangle object representing the boundary or hitbox of the wall.
Constructor:

Initializes the wall object with the specified parameters (Color, x, y, width, height).
Sets the initial position (x, y), color, and creates a hitbox using the Rectangle class.
Methods:

draw(Graphics2D gtd): Draws the wall on the screen using the Graphics2D object provided. It outlines the wall with a black border and fills it with the specified color.
set(int cameraX): Updates the wall's position based on the cameraX value, which is typically used for scrolling or camera movements in games. It adjusts the x coordinate based on the initial startX and the camera's position.
Functionality:

The class encapsulates the properties and behavior of a wall object, allowing it to be drawn on a graphical interface.
The draw method is responsible for rendering the wall visually on the screen.
The set method updates the wall's position to simulate movement, particularly in relation to the camera's position (used in scrolling games).
Usage:

This class would typically be used in conjunction with other game or graphical elements within a larger application.
It provides a way to create and manipulate walls, representing them as graphical objects with specific properties and behaviors.
Overall, the Wall class serves as a building block for representing and managing walls in a game or graphical application, handling their rendering and positional updates.
