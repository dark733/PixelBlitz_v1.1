In the provided code:

1. **`game_one_i` abstract class**:
   - It's an abstract class that declares an abstract method `game_one_event()`.
   - Any class extending `game_one_i` must provide an implementation for the `game_one_event()` method.

2. **`game_one` class**:
   - Extends `game_one_i` and implements the `game_one_event()` method.
   - The `game_one_event()` method initializes the Game One by printing a message and calling the `main_fun_g1()` method.

3. **`main_fun_g1()` method**:
   - This method initializes a `MainFrameOne` object, sets its size, location, title, and visibility.
   - It creates a window for a platformer game using `JFrame`, setting some properties like size, position, title, and visibility.

This code structure outlines an abstract class `game_one_i` that specifies an abstract method. Its child class `game_one` provides an implementation for that method to initialize and display a platformer game window using Swing components.
